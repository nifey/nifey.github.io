	<meta name="description" content="In this post, I am sharing my goals for the next 6 months.
The reason I&rsquo;m doing this is to keep myself motivated and also to let other mozillians know what I&rsquo;m up to.

Learn Rust. Learning more about the rust language is my first priority. In this 6 months I want to learn about:

Unit Testing
Networking in rust
basics of functional programming
If possible, using threads in rust


Contribute to some simple, open source rust projects.
Learn Deep learning and contribute to DeepRust crate.
Contribute to Servo, the Rust browser engine. I plan to first try out the servo engine and find ways to contribute to it.
Write tutorials. I am going to write beginner level tutorials to help those who are just starting out.

A few days back I came to know about the MozillaTN meetup which is going to happen at Coimbatore this January. I haven&rsquo;t met any mozillians yet. So I am super excited about this meetup. I am looking forward to attending this meetup. I wish to meet some rust developers and do something awesome with them. :)" />
