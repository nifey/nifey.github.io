<p>Rust is a system programming language that focusses on three aspects: Speed, Safety and Concurrency. It is being developed by an active community of programmers. Its development is officially sponsored by Mozilla.</p>
<h3 id="installing-rust">Installing rust</h3>
<p>First, we have to install the rust compiler which is called <strong>rustc</strong> and <strong>cargo</strong> ,rust&rsquo;s package manager. I recommend installing rustc and cargo using rustup. Why rustup? Before answering that I have to mention that rustc comes in three versions : Stable , Beta and Nightly.</p>
<p><strong>Rustup</strong> is a multi toolchain installer that lets you manage different versions of rustc and also lets you cross compile for different architectures and operating systems. Simply put , it makes installation easy.</p>
<p>To install rustup ,go to rustup.rs and follow the instructions.</p>
<p>Sometimes you have to add the path of  cargo directory to the environment variables.</p>
<p>In linux , type in</p>
<p><code>export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.cargo/bin</code></p>
<p>where $HOME/.cargo/bin is the default cargo directory.</p>
<p>After installing , type in rustc and cargo in the terminal or command prompt. If it prints unknown command , you probably have not installed it properly.</p>
<h3 id="writing-rust-code">Writing rust code</h3>
<p>To write rust code , you can use an ordinary text editor or you can install bindings for popular IDEs. I&rsquo;ll have links to that below.</p>
<p>I recommend using Atom. It has a lot of packages that helps in writing rust code. If you are going to use atom then be sure to install the following packages.</p>
<h3 id="atom-packages-for-rust">Atom packages for rust:</h3>
<ul>
<li>language-rust</li>
<li>linter-rust (shows errors while typing  )</li>
<li>rustfmt  (formats code while saving the file)</li>
<li>racer (code completion utility)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="hello-world">Hello World</h3>
<p>So now that you have installed rustc and cargo. Let&rsquo;s create a sample program. To create a binary application using cargo run :</p>
<p><code>cargo new helloworld --bin</code></p>
<p>Cargo automatically creates a hello world program in a file named main.rs in the src folder. To build it open terminal in the project directory and run</p>
<p><code>cargo build</code></p>
<p>This will create an executable in the debug folder. To run this program type in</p>
<p><code>cargo run</code></p>
<p>If you see Hello World printed on the screen then you have just executed your first rust program.</p>
