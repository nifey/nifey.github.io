      <description>Usually when an attacker exploits a vulnerability, the attack starts out as a Illegal memory access or Control flow hijack, which the attacker would use to write to sensitive memory locations or execute arbitrary code in supervisor mode, to try to increase privileges in the system.&#xA;Illegal memory accesses are memory accesses which the programmer didn&amp;rsquo;t intend to happen, which allows attackers to read or write to some memory locations. Illegal memory accesses can be classified on three aspects: Read or Write access Access to Arbitrary address or restricted address If it is a write, Arbitrary value or restricted value write Write accesses and arbitrary address/value writes are more serious bugs, as they allow attackers more control over where or what value they can write, making it easier to subvert execution.</description>

      <guid>https://nihaal.me/post/fixing_syzbot_bugs/</guid>
      <description>Syzbot is an automated fuzzing infrastructure that uses Syzkaller to perform continuous fuzzing, primarily on the Linux kernel. Whenever it finds bugs, Syzbot reports it to the relevant mailing list. It also has a public dashboard where it lists all the open bugs that needs to be fixed.&#xA;Syzbot is quite effective in finding bugs in the kernel but due to the large number of bugs being found, many of them don&amp;rsquo;t get fixed in time.</description>

      <guid>https://nihaal.me/post/coccinelle/</guid>
      <description>Coccinelle is static analysis tool used for semantic pattern matching and automated transformation of C programs. It is written in OCaml. Unlike other pattern matching tools like grep which use regular expressions, Coccinelle understands C syntax and can find semantic code pattern in the source code and automatically transform them, irrespective of the name of identifiers, comments or formatting.&#xA;Coccinelle is intraprocedural, i.e. all its matching and transformation happens within functions.</description>

      <description>Disclaimer: I&amp;rsquo;m no expert in this. This post is just to collect all my thoughts and lessons learnt from random talks and blogs, about research.&#xA;What is research?&#xA;Research is producing new knowledge. The aim of research is to do something novel (new) and useful. The purpose of literature survey is to ensure that our idea is new and has not been proposed before. And the purpose of evaluations is to show that our idea or technique is useful.</description>

      <guid>https://nihaal.me/post/kernel_sanitizers/</guid>
      <description>When fuzzing a program by feeding random inputs to it, we need a mechanism to tell when the program is doing unexpected things. Sanitizers help detect bugs in the program at runtime. They are usually used along with fuzzing to detect bugs in programs.&#xA;The two roles of sanitizers:&#xA;Detect incorrect program behaviour: like accessing memory that the program is not supposed to access Report incorrect behaviour: To be useful, the sanitizer needs to report useful information (like the stack trace and ) that makes it easier to understand and fix the bug.</description>

      <guid>https://nihaal.me/post/kernel_fuzzing/</guid>
      <description>In this post, we&amp;rsquo;ll see how fuzzing is used for finding different types of bugs in the Linux kernel. This post consists of my notes taken from the talk by Andrey Konavalov about Linux fuzzing.&#xA;Operating systems kernels are complex. Testing kernels is of prime importance since any vulnerability in the kernel can lead to compromising the whole system.&#xA;Fuzzing is a dynamic program analysis technique, used to find bugs in software.</description>

      <description>One of the hurdles in contributing to Linux kernel as a beginner is to find something to work on. If you are working as a kernel developer or are a part of a kernel mentorship program, this shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a problem. But for others, the first step is to send a bunch of coding style fixes for warnings reported by checkpatch.&#xA;In addition to checkpatch, there are many other static analysis tools like sparse, coccinelle and smatch, used to analyse source code and find possible bugs.</description>

      <description>Compression is a common technique that allows us to reduce the size of data. We use it when we store or send files as zip, 7z or rar archives. It helps reduce the space occupied by files in the filesystem and also to save bandwidth while transferring over a network.&#xA;In general, compression algorithms try to encode redundancy or regularity in data with lesser bits.&#xA;There are many different software compression algorithms available.</description>

      <description>The usability of a programming language depends on many factors and one of them is the availability of good libraries to build on. When libraries are available, we also need a way to search and download libraries with ease. Most modern langauges maintain some form of index to make dependency management easier. Examples include Crates.io for Rust and PyPI for Python.&#xA;Python Package Index (PyPI) is an index and repository of Python packages.</description>

      <description>The kernel provides a few ways in which userspace programs can get information from the kernel space.&#xA;procfs: Used to get information about running processes debugfs: Used by kernel developers for debugging sysfs Sysfs is used for data that is not related to a particular process. It has information about hardware devices attached to the system and about drivers handling those devices.&#xA;Any file added to the sysfs becomes a part of the Linux Application Binary Interface (ABI).</description>

      <description>Accessing hardware devices like files An important role of the operating system is to allow the user applications to access hardware resources. It has to allow the user programs to use hardware while also ensuring that the applications have permissions to access it and don&amp;rsquo;t misuse them.&#xA;To simplify access to hardware, Unix, by design, exposes most of the hardware devices to userspace as device files, usually present under /dev directory.</description>

      <description>debugfs debugfs is a pseudo-filesystem used for kernel debugging. It is usually mounted at /sys/kernel/debug. debugfs contains files that allow us to read debugging information.&#xA;By default, only the root user can cd into the /sys/kernel/debug directory.&#xA;To change it to allow the current user to cd into debugfs, we can remount it with uid set to the current user&amp;rsquo;s uid.&#xA;sudo umount /sys/kernel/debug sudo mount -t debugfs none /sys/kernel/debug -o uid=`echo $UID` cd /sys/kernel/debug Creating debugfs entries Creating debugfs files is similar to creating character device files.</description>

      <description>Character Devices, Major and Minor numbers Based on granularity of access, there are two classes of devices:&#xA;Character devices are accessed as a stream of bytes. Eg: Keyboards Block devices are accessed in blocks. For instance, hard disks transfer data in blocks of multiple bytes at a time. The kernel uses major and minor numbers to identify the attached hardware devices. Major number usually tells us the type of device. Minor numbers are used to differentiate two or more devices with the same major number.</description>

      <description>A Loadable Kernel Module (LKM) is a piece of code that can be loaded to a running kernel to add additional functionality to the kernel. The code that runs as a kernel module will be executed with kernel privileges. Most operating system kernels support kernel modules.&#xA;The advantage of using kernel modules is that it can be loaded to and unloaded from the kernel without the need to recompile or reboot the kernel.</description>

      <description>The Rust programming language Rust is a system programming language that focusses on three aspects: Speed, Safety and Concurrency. It is being developed by an active community of programmers. Its development is officially sponsored by Mozilla.&#xA;Installing rust First, we have to install the rust compiler which is called rustc and cargo ,rust&amp;rsquo;s package manager. I recommend installing rustc and cargo using rustup. Why rustup? Before answering that I have to mention that rustc comes in three versions : Stable , Beta and Nightly.</description>
