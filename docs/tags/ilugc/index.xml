      <description>In this post, I want to share what I did for Hacktoberfest.&#xA;Hacktoberfest is a month-long program to motivate people to contribute to open source software. All you have to do is give 4 pull requests to any public repository on Github. The reward is a cool t-shirt and Github stickers. These contributions should be made in the month of October to be counted for hacktoberfest.&#xA;I searched for a project I can contribute to.</description>
