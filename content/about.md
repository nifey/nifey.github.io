- I'm a PhD student focussing on Linux kernel security and Static analysis. I work with [Prof. Chester Rebeiro](https://cse.iitm.ac.in/~chester/) and [Prof. Madhu Mutyam](https://cse.iitm.ac.in/~madhu/).
  **My current research** is on detecting memory leaks in the Linux kernel using static analysis. A list of memory leaks that we have detected and fixed can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vREgEjH21e0OygLBQ8D20FkhNTDXCrZIDkwWykv21STmx16QlgFiveawTFcTD6Bs2R0pHVoeC2nzDrT/pubhtml)‚≠ê.
- I occasionally [write](https://nihaal.me) and collect interesting [git repositories](https://github.com/nifey?tab=stars).
